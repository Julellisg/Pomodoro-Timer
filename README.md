1. Progression. Informs you if you are **WORKING** or **RESTING**. The smaller number in square brackets represents what set you are currently on. 
2. You have the freedom of **pausing/resuming,** **skipping** to the next work/rest session, and **resetting** the timer completely. 
3. These input boxes While the timer is running, the input boxes are temporarily disabled and you cannot edit any values.
4. Button that is currently **unactive**. Pressing it reveals the accordion that reveals more options.

5. Button that is currently **active**.
6. Sound effects referring to what is played whenever the timer reaches `00:00`. If more sound effects are added, then they will be placed in this section. 
7. A wide variety of different ambient soundtracks to relax and to study to. Mix, match, and adjust the volumes to your desired output.
8. Different color themes to choose from. Raki (left) and Chiaki (right).
(Raki is my favorite :blush:)
